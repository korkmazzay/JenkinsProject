Why local computers and laptops are not hosting websites?
1) We have to keep laptop/computer on all the time
2) We have to make sure its secure all the time
3) We have to make sure the laptop or computer is always connected to power and internet
For these reasons we use servers
Always connected to power and high speed internet
Special layers of physical security

SDLC:
1) BA collects the requirements from the client and creates
software requirement specification SRS
2) Architects will create the software design document
3) Developers develop the code on local computers and once ready they run tests
cases and once all the test cases are passed they will request the IT department
to deploy this code to Dev Server
4) QA will request IT or devops team to deploy the code on QA servers QA will verify the change and
start testing it
5) If required application is delayed on performance and security servers.
6) Once everything is tested on QA server application is deployed on staging server
7) Once testing is completed on staging it will be deployed on UAT servers
8) Production server
